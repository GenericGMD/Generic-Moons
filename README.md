Currently trying to make a lethal company moon expansion mod with 1 moon per difficulty. Currently only have 1 which is a frozen over lake in the mountains. There are some bugs (should only be visual) as this is my first time using unity.


Please note.
I have no idea what im doing. I've never used unity before and I never used Thunderstore before. If you can share any assistance on how to fix the lighting problem or just any other things please dm me on discord. My tag is generic_gmd.
